# tic-tac-go

IMPORTANT: this project implements "tic-tac-go" (not tic-tac-toe).

Short description
- Minimal Rust skeleton for implementing the tic-tac-go game.

Basic rules (provided by project owner)
- Aim: form exactly three circles in a straight line (three in a row) to score/win.
- Crosses act as movable obstacles.
- You lose if three crosses become aligned in a straight line.
- Your character is a circle that can push other crosses or circles.
- The playing field may have a random shape; implementations should account for varied board geometry.

Running locally
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run`

Notes
- These rules are the concise, owner-provided basics to include in this repository's README; implementational details and edge cases should be defined in code or additional docs.
